# Front-Scoar 
### ( An Online teaching and student management portal)

> **NOTE 1:** This was a MVP which I developed for a startup [Scoar](https://www.linkedin.com/company/topscoar/) during my internship period at the company. **The frontend of the application was completely developed by me from scratch.** _I have taken permission from the company to put the code publicly on my github profile as one of my projects._
>
> **NOTE 2:**  For the Demo, I had to disconnect the app from the backend and use sample response data to mock API calls. The deployed app is just for the demo and not connected to any backend (so, you may expect some features e.g login/signup to not work). 
**This [deployed demo app](https://scoar.shubhamprakash.dev/) is just to demonstrate my frontend skills and my ability to build such a feature-rich complex platform from scratch.**
